Sudoku Solver in Java
This project is a Sudoku Solver implemented in Java. It allows users to input a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle and solves it using a backtracking algorithm. The program ensures that the solution adheres to the standard Sudoku rules, where every row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid contains the numbers 1 through 9 exactly once.
